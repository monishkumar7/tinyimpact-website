          <FAQAnswer>
            {tinyimpact} exists to show that NFTs can be used for good. <br />
            <br />
            NFTs are the building blocks of the future of Internet. Their
            applications will be beyond our expectations. <br />
            <br />
            But at the moment, too many projects are trying to do the same thing
            without leveraging the potential of NFTs. <br />

            Once the <i>Impact1</i> collection sells out and $25,000 is raised
            for charity, I expect to make this an annual thing. <br />
            <br />
            Each year, I will work with a designer to generate unique art that
            you can purchase and 100% of the proceeds will go to a charity
            decided by DAO members. <br />
            <br />
            Before <i>Impact2</i> collection, a formal DAO will be setup.

          <FAQQuestion>Are NFTs a scam?</FAQQuestion>
          <FAQAnswer>
            Most of them are not. Some of them are. I have been burned myself a
            few times trusting the wrong projects. But more often, I have seen
            tremendous amount of energy and time people put behind their
            projects. <br />
            <br />
            Why do NFTs get a bad name in the press? It is normal for people to
            make fun of things I don't understand. A year back, I honestly did
            not understand people spending hundreds of thousands in buying NFTs.
            Now, I do. <br />
